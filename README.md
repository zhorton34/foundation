### @findhow/foundation (Work in progress)

`@findhow/foundation` is a foundational library that extends from our
`@findhow/container` dependency injection service container package.

By implementing an additional layer on top of the `@findhow/container`, we are
able to build out the foundation for a simple framework - thus this package is
called `@findhow/foundation` (inspired by laravel architecture and naming
conventions).
